üö¶ AI-Powered Traffic Flow Optimization System
üìù Introduction


This project is a simple simulation of an AI-powered traffic signal controller designed to optimize traffic flow at a 4-way intersection. It uses basic logic to mimic how AI can dynamically control traffic lights based on real-time traffic conditions, reducing congestion and improving efficiency.

üéØ Objective


To simulate an AI-based system that automatically assigns green signals to lanes with the highest vehicle count.

To understand basic traffic optimization using Python.

To demonstrate how intelligent traffic control systems can be implemented in smart cities.

üìä Data Source


This is a simulation-based project, so there is no real-world traffic data used. Traffic values are generated randomly using Python to mimic real traffic conditions.

In a real-world scenario, data would be collected from:

CCTV cameras

Traffic sensors (IoT devices)

GPS & mobile data

üíª Technology Used


Python 3: Main programming language

Random module: To simulate traffic vehicle counts

Time module: For delay between cycles

(Optional) matplotlib & numpy: For advanced simulation and graph plotting
